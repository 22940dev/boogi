Create awesome documentation or tutorial pages following modern look-and-feel.
Customize it to your needs

## Motivation

Goal is to give teams powerful tool which they can use to efficiently and
collaboratively share their knowledge. They can easily host it on any
infrastructure of choice or SaaS hosting like Netlify, Vercel or
GitHub / GitLab Pages. We want to provide a product, which can be customized
to (nearly) any needs, either using basic or advanced configuration options.

BooGi is inspired by popular [Gitbook](https://gitbook.com) look and feel.
It offers custom styling and components that enable building beautiful documentation
for projects and products quickly. It follows docs-as-code principles, where
you treat your documentation in the same way as your code.

To serve all these requirements, we decided to use Gatsby + MDX (Markdown + JSX) 
to extend markdown and used a neat consistent theme like the one at 
[GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com).

It is a fork of https://github.com/hasura/gatsby-gitbook-starter. Intention
is to improve this starter to provide significantly more features, make 
look-and-feel more similar to Gitbook, improve stability, performance,
make it more configurable and easier to start.
